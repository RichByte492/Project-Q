# Project-Q
Simple Timer To brush up on css and html 
It took some some hours to build and it was a by product lol :) hope is is usefull !


This project took much time than ancitipated 
---> I had to learn some advance CSS and javascript part for the timer 

Here is the plan for the project 

Phase 1: Planning and Setup (Hour 1-2)

Define the project scope and features.
Set up the project structure using a code editor and create necessary files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
Initialize a Git repository for version control.

Phase 2: Core Timer Functionality (Hour 3-6)

Implement the basic timer functionality (start, pause, reset) using the provided code.
Create a separate JavaScript module for the timer to keep the code organized.
Add basic styles to the timer and buttons using the provided CSS.


Phase 3: Progress Bar and Visual Enhancements (Hour 7-10)

Implement the progress bar and connect it to the timer.
Add visual enhancements like the glitch and scanline effects using CSS animations.
Improve the overall styling and layout of the application.

nearly Im documenting this after 10 hour : progress I am done with the basic styling and a basic timer 

Phase 4: Advanced Timer Features (Hour 11-16)

Add a lap/split functionality to record intermediate time intervals.
Implement a countdown mode with an input field to set the initial time.
Add an option to switch between 12-hour and 24-hour time formats.
Implement a feature to persist the timer state in local storage, so it remains intact after a page refresh.

Phase 05 : I worked on making the website optimised for different screens this took about 30 minutes of research and coding 

Phase 06 : this part took me around 20 hour or less 
I was involved in making a good functional timer so I had to implement quite number of javascript functions and the debugging part took me like 2 hours 

This was done in slow pace as I needed to bursh up on the JS part while I was doing the project 

and Finally hosted on github repo and the site is online 
In future hope to update this clock for additional functionalities :)
